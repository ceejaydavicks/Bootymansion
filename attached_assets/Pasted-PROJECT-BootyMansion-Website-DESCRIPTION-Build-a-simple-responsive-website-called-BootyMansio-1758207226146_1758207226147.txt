PROJECT: BootyMansion Website

DESCRIPTION:
Build a simple, responsive website called BootyMansion. 
It should look like a social media-style feed where I can upload images or videos of different models. 
Users should be able to click any model’s image to see their profile page with more photos/videos and a bio.

CORE FEATURES:
1. HOMEPAGE
- Grid layout (3–4 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile).
- Each post shows:
   • Thumbnail (image/video preview)
   • Model name
   • Short caption
- Infinite scroll or pagination so I can keep adding content.

2. CATEGORY FILTERS
- Add clickable buttons/tabs for categories like:
   • Latina
   • Asian
   • Ebony
   • Thick
   • Blonde
   • Trending
- When clicked, show only models in that category.
- Category filter should be visible at the top of the feed.

3. PROFILE PAGES
- Larger header image of the model
- Model bio/description
- Gallery grid with more photos or videos
- Space for related models (“You might also like” section).

4. ADMIN PANEL (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Simple dashboard where I can:
   • Upload new images/videos and assign category + caption
   • Edit or delete posts anytime
   • Manage categories (add/remove)
   • Control ads (see below)

5. ADS & MONETIZATION
- Homepage:
   • Banner slot under header (rotatable)
   • Native ad card after every 6–8 model posts
   • Sticky footer ad bar for mobile (with close button)
- Profile Page:
   • Banner slot under model name/photo
   • Native ad slot between gallery rows
   • Bottom CTA button/banner ("Watch Live Cams" or other offers)
- Admin dashboard should allow me to change ads anytime (paste new HTML/JS ad code or image+link).

6. DESIGN STYLE
- Clean, modern look
- Dark mode by default (black or deep grey background, white text)
- Rounded cards with hover effect
- Mobile-first design (should look good on small screens)

7. PERFORMANCE
- Fast loading, image lazy-loading for performance
- SEO-friendly (each model profile should have its own shareable link)

8. EXTRAS I RECOMMEND
- Search bar so users can type a model name
- "Trending" section for most clicked profiles
- Simple analytics (number of clicks per model)
- Social sharing buttons (copy link to share)

TECH STACK SUGGESTION:
- Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MongoDB or Firebase (for easy data management)
- Admin panel: Simple React dashboard for uploads & ad management
